# NASA - "Astronomy Photo of the Day"

## Description

A React SPA that consumes and displays a 3rd party API (https://api.nasa.gov/#apod) using an API key provided by NASA, to display an "Astronomy Photo of the Day" along with a title, date, copyright information, and description.

## Contributions

On initial render, the photo of the day is of today's current date. Programmed a function to insert an optional query param ('date') into the endpoint and fetch as selected from the calendar input. Reactstrap for app layout and design components.
